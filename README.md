# DSiUtil

DSiUtil is a website that I wrote that lets you view images taken with your DSi on your SD Card that runs 100% in your web browser. It is styled like the Nintendo DSi Camera app.

## Features:
- Shows photos you have taken using Nintendo DSi Camera or [DSi Camera Test](https://github.com/Epicpkmn11/dsi-camera)
- Shows the date of when you took those photos
- You can save the photos elsewhere by right clicking the preview photo (adding a dedicated button for this soon)

## Plans: 
- Allow you to rotate images and download those rotated images
- Read Nintendo DSi Camera pit.bin data for sticker albums (:star::clubs: :hearts:)
- Support uploading audio for DSi Sound
- allow you install as a PWA
